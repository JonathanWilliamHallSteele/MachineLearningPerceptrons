Sensor holds weights and activations for each sensor node. The first sensor in sensors[] holds the output node\'92s bias\
Instance holds all information for a given row of inputs and outputs\
Instances organizes all Instance variables\
\
Forward_Propagation is used to calculate the output\
Train_Test is used to adjust weights and bias for one training Instance\
